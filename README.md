### *Project Description/Outline*

#### Background:
Happiness is one of the most abstract terms in the world. What makes you happy? Is it money, love, family, or perhaps your career? 

Often, the reports of the happiest place to live in are published. Have these ever made you wonder, what are the metrics used to determine a Happiness Score for a country?

The purpose of this project is to use open data sources to answer the following research questions: 
1. Which region has the happiest countries? 
2. Does the level of income show greater impact on happiness score? 
3. Are there other influential factors with greater impact on happiness score compared to level of income?

Two CSV files were extrapolated from Kaggle Website. The datasets have world income by country and happiness report by country. The world income data identifies the level of income for each country. The happiness report contains the happiness score for 156 countries for the year 2019 based on several factors such as gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, social support, perceptions of corruption, and freedom to make choices.
